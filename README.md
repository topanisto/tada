# TADA: Time-Assured Deniable Authentication

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION ‼️ 
> This is a proof of concept. 

A library of circuits for TADA, or [Time-Assured Deniable Authentication](https://hackmd.io/b9e47uvCQ7u8psDqM05toA). We use a [Rust implementation](https://github.com/topanisto/timed-commitments) of Boneh-Naor timed commitments as well as [0xPARC's ECDSA circom-ecdsa circuits](https://github.com/0xPARC/circom-ecdsa/tree/d87eb7068cb35c951187093abe966275c1839ead) to make example TADA attestation proofs.
